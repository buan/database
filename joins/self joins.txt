Self join is not another type of join
It is splitting up a table into 2 seperate tables and do any type of join
It can be classified as inner,outer,full join

EmployeeID|Name|ManagerId
1                   Mike        3
2                   Rob         1
3                   Todd        NULL
4                   Ben         1
5                   Sam        1

So suppose we want to fetch the employees and their manager names.So we need to reference the EmployeeID for this tanle.We need to join same table with itself

Our output is
Mike Todd
Rob Mike
Todd NULL
Ben Mike
Sam Mike


Left join=SELECT a.name,b.name FROM selfjoin a LEFT JOIN selfjoin b ON a.managerid=b.employeeid

So we get all matching rows from both tables+non matching rows from left table.

So we get to know those employees who doesnt have a manager

Right join=We will get those employees who is not a manager.say Rob,Ben,Sam
So we get all matching rows from both tables+non matching rows from right table.


SELECT a.name,b.name FROM selfjoin a RIGHT JOIN selfjoin b ON a.managerid=b.employeeid


Mike Todd
Rob Mike
Ben Mike
Sam Mike
NULL Rob
NULL Ben
NULL Sam


Inner join=This will give all matching rows

SELECT a.name manager,b.name employee FROM selfjoin a INNER JOIN selfjoin b ON a.managerid=b.employeeid
Cross JOIN=Cartesian Product
