Inner Join:Returns matching rows between two tables are retrieved

Eg:
Customers
======
ID|Name|Department
1   Soumya      3
2   Suman         1
3   Amit       NULL

Department
=======
Id|Dname
1   Computer
2   Physics
3   Chemistry

Notice here Amit doesnt have any Department name here. So Inner Joins will not show Amit as there is no department NULL which matches with Department table. So only matching rows are retrieved

Query
=====
Select * from Customers c
Join
Department d
on
c.department=d.department
Cross Join =Cartesian product. 


LEFT Join:
=========
Returns matching and non matching rows for the left table between two tables are retrieved

Same for Right Join
=================
Returns matching and non matching rows for the right table between two tables are retrieved

Full Outer Join
============
Returns matching and non matching rows for the left and right table between two tables are retrieved

SELECT t1.ID,t1.name,t1.gender,t1.salary,t2.DepartmentName FROM `tblemployee` t1
FULL OUTER JOIN
tbldepartment t2
ON
t1.DepartmentId=t2.ID

Cross Join
==========
Cartesian Product used to entry rows in bulk


Intelligence Joins
==============
Returns all rows except matching rows between two tables are retrieved

Same query,only add 
where departmentid is NULL
